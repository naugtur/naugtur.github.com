    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      I have been working with JavaScript since 2008, and with Node.js since 2011. I have been teaching JavaScript diagnostics, maintainability and security topics while maintaining a full-time job where I get to stay hands-on. 
    </p>
    <p>I've performed my workshops for international audiences at NodeConfEU in Ireland and DEFCON in the USA among others.</p>

    <h3>What's unique about these trainings?</h3>

    <p> I focus on advanced topics and go deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of my trainings is adjusted for the group I'm teaching. Before the training, I like to meet them for 15-20 minutes
      to
      get the feel of what they need and avoid making them sit through the first 2 hours of listening to what they
      already
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy sharing knowledge. I don't have a marketing team to feed, I don't have quality graphics. I
      improvise
      often. You get just the juiciest bits, not a sunk-cost-fallacy driven pre-packaged slide deck I have to sell
      tens of times for good ROI.
