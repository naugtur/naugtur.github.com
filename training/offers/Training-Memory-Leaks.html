      <h1>JavaScript memory management and leaks</h1>
<p>Browser + Node.js</p>
<p>Learn how memory works and how to use tools to track down a memory leak.
No matter if you have a year or 10 years of experience with JavaScript, this is something you&#39;ll be able to use right away and something you likely don&#39;t know yet.</p>
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to garbage collection</li>
<li>Getting basic memory consumption info</li>
<li>Generating heapdumps - with devtools and programmatically (node.js)</li>
<li>Finding a memory leak - practice with example apps<ul>
<li>browser</li>
<li>node.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours total with breaks and Q&amp;A  </p>
<p>Can be split to cover just the browser or node.js - in 5-6 hours.</p>
<h2>Who should attend?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developers working on heavy web applications - for basic memory management awareness</li>
<li>Senior/Principal Engineers - to gain a fundamental skill for their job before they face an incident with memory leaks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of JavaScript for the browser and Node.js</li>
<li>At least a month (yes, just a month should be enough) of experience working on web application products, as a front-end or back-end engineer.</li>
<li>Chromium-based browser and Node.js LTS installed</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      I have been working with JavaScript since 2008, and with Node.js since 2011. I have been teaching JavaScript diagnostics, maintainability and security topics while maintaining a full-time job where I get to stay hands-on. 
    </p>
    <p>I've performed my workshops for international audiences at NodeConfEU in Ireland and DEFCON in the USA among others.</p>

    <h3>What's unique about these trainings?</h3>

    <p> I focus on advanced topics and go deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of my trainings is adjusted for the group I'm teaching. Before the training, I like to meet them for 15-20 minutes
      to
      get the feel of what they need and avoid making them sit through the first 2 hours of listening to what they
      already
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy sharing knowledge. I don't have a marketing team to feed, I don't have quality graphics. I
      improvise
      often. You get just the juiciest bits, not a sunk-cost-fallacy driven pre-packaged slide deck I have to sell
      tens of times for good ROI.
