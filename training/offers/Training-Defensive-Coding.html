      <h1>Defensive Coding</h1>
<p>It&#39;s rare to see applications that don&#39;t contain any external code coming from strangers. Someone else&#39;s code
might affect yours via protoype poisoning even if you never interact with it. It&#39;s a threat as long as it&#39;s
running in the same process.
No matter if you&#39;re concerned with malicious dependencies or building software to run other people&#39;s code,
techniques presented in this workshop can be used to isolate code at runtime and protect against prototype
poisoning.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll explore the techniques allowing cooperation with neighbors that mess with built-in functionality of
JavaScript not only for benign reasons, but also in dangerous ways.
The second part of the workshop will focus on using tools to isolate code and scale the defensive coding
practice up for larger codebases.</p>
<p>The entire workshop will be delivered as bite-sized hands-on exercises where increasingly advanced threats are
presented and the participant has to defend their code.</p>
<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to prototype poisoning</li>
<li>Offensive techniques for pivoting with prototype poisoning by example</li>
<li>Defensive techniques for isolating code</li>
<li>Using tools to scale defensive coding practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to modern software composition risks: the problem of fearless collaboration and supply chain security</li>
<li>Prototype poisoning: what it is and how it works</li>
<li>Increasingly difficult exercises exploring the methods of Defensive Coding</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>includes increasingly advanced prototype pollution attacks</li>
<li>majority of the workshop is spent here</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Introduction to Hardened JavaScript and LavaMoat - tools created to scale the runtime defense approach.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours total with breaks and Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Can be expanded with full hands-on LavaMoat configuration and troubleshooting training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This training was originally created for and delivered at DEFCON AppSec Village and later NodeConfEU, ConfidenceCon, x33fcon.
It was refined in the process, so what you&#39;re getting is an improved version of what people enjoyed in Vegas.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      I have been working with JavaScript since 2008, and with Node.js since 2011. I have been teaching JavaScript diagnostics, maintainability and security topics while maintaining a full-time job where I get to stay hands-on. 
    </p>
    <p>I've performed my workshops for international audiences at NodeConfEU in Ireland and DEFCON in the USA among others.</p>

    <h3>What's unique about these trainings?</h3>

    <p> I focus on advanced topics and go deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of my trainings is adjusted for the group I'm teaching. Before the training, I like to meet them for 15-20 minutes
      to
      get the feel of what they need and avoid making them sit through the first 2 hours of listening to what they
      already
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy sharing knowledge. I don't have a marketing team to feed, I don't have quality graphics. I
      improvise
      often. You get just the juiciest bits, not a sunk-cost-fallacy driven pre-packaged slide deck I have to sell
      tens of times for good ROI.
