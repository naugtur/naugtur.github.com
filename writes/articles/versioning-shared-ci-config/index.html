          <section class="content"><p>Gitlab <span class="caps">CI</span> is one of a bunch of CIs configurable with a file in the repository. With over 25 repositories sharing a similar configuration maintenance becomes&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<cut>

<p>My team is building integrations. We can’t seem to stop. There’s over 20 of them now and each has a build&nbsp;pipeline.</p>
<p>We even managed to get them to be really consistent in terms of tooling, builds and deployment. <code>sed</code> in a loop was my editor of choice for a while. Now with everything reaching consistency, it’s time to address the&nbsp;overlap.</p>
<h4 id="but-how-">But&nbsp;how?</h4>
<p><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> defines the pipeline, so it’s not possible to install something external as the first step of the pipeline to affect the rest. <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> allows importing external files from the repo or a <span class="caps">URL</span>. That sounds&nbsp;great. </p>
<p>External URLs don’t support authorization, so we’d have to put some infrastructure in place to have parts of <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> shared between projects, but not available to general public. You know,&nbsp;security.</p>
<p>Also, if all configs point to the same <span class="caps">URL</span>, it’s just one version shared across all pipelines. Instant updates or no&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>The big leap I had to make was to think of <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> as code not&nbsp;configuration. </p>
<p>If it’s code, I need to reuse it. If I’m reusing code, I put it in a shared library. If I have a library, I version it so I don’t have to spend a few days rolling it out to each project with each change, but can do so progressively when revisiting projects while they continue to work fine with previous&nbsp;version.</p>
<p>The idea is not new. We’re using internal libraries to reuse code better. Logger, database abstractions etc. - they’re all packages we install in each app and their development follows semantic&nbsp;versioning.</p>
<h4 id="here-s-what-i-did">Here’s what I&nbsp;did</h4>
<p>Turn it into a&nbsp;library:</p>
<ul>
<li>extract common steps to&nbsp;files</li>
<li>give them descriptive stage&nbsp;names</li>
<li>parametrize with&nbsp;variables</li>
</ul>
<p>I can include a file and use a stage from it, put it in the right order with others etc.
Included stages are configured with variables. Variables from the main yaml are accessible in included&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Make it&nbsp;installabe:</p>
<ul>
<li>set up a repository for the library as a npm compatible&nbsp;package</li>
<li>use a <code>install</code> script to take a folder with reusable files and copy it to the folder of the app installing my package as&nbsp;dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>When I install the library at a certain version, I get a folder with reusable yaml in my repo root. Just need to commit it and it can be included in the main <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>.</p>
<p>We now have full control of the versions. If I want to update the <span class="caps">CI</span> pipeline across all apps, I run <code>npm update gitlabci-shared-config</code> in a loop across repositories and commit changes. If I need to update the version for only one app, or the update requires changes in the app itself - I have control over how and when the update rolls&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Also, the generated folder comes with a readme file explaining usage docs matching the installed version and a version file containing the version number so it’s easy to spot if/when it goes out of&nbsp;sync.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like when&nbsp;used</p>
<pre><code class="lang-yaml"><span class="attr">variables:</span>
  ...
<span class="attr">  CURRENT_NODE_ALPINE:</span> <span class="string">"node:10-alpine"</span>
<span class="attr">  GCR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME:</span> <span class="string">"..."</span>

<span class="attr">include:</span> 
<span class="bullet">  -</span> <span class="string">"/gitlabci-shared-config/dependencies.yml"</span>
<span class="bullet">  -</span> <span class="string">"/gitlabci-shared-config/build.yml"</span>

<span class="attr">stages:</span>
<span class="bullet">  -</span> setup_dependencies
<span class="bullet">  -</span> build_image_prod
<span class="bullet">  -</span> test
  ...

<span class="attr">unittesting:</span>
<span class="attr">  stage:</span> test
  ...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="known-issues">Known&nbsp;issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unused stages cause errors, each stage needs to be in a separate file with only the used ones included to <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code></li>
<li>There’s no obvious way to stop someone from editing the installed files - they have to be committed to the repo because there’s no step before <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> includes other than git&nbsp;commit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve been using this for a few weeks now and It’s proving useful for sharing parts of Gitlab <span class="caps">CI</span> configuration across 25 independent&nbsp;apps.  </p>
<p>I should post some more tips for dealing with maintenance across many applications without the need of a monorepo. Maybe a series of posts? Let me know on&nbsp;twitter.</p>
<p>More updates on shared <span class="caps">CI</span> config coming&nbsp;soon!</p>
