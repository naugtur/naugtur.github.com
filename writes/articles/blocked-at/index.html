          <section class="content"><p>Node.js introduced Async Hooks in version 8 and I could finally do what I always wanted - make a tool to tell me what is blocking the event&nbsp;loop.</p>
<cut>

<p>Let’s start with stating the obvious - Node.js programs are asynchronous and it’s for a reason. That reason is called <em>event loop</em> and if it’s not a familiar word yet, read up on single threaded asynchronous nature of Node.js - it’s&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>I’ll continue with the assumption that running long synchronous operations in Node.js is something you want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-blocked-state">Detecting blocked&nbsp;state</h2>
<p>In early days of Node, the only way to detect a function blocking the event loop was to notice your server stops accepting new requests for a while. Or use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/blocked"><code>blocked</code></a> package, which uses a neat hack for detecting blockage by (and I’m simplifying) measuring how late a <code>setTimeout</code> callback is compared to when it should have been&nbsp;called.</p>
<p>There’s other ways to determine where a lot of <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles are spent. You can use flame grapths but if your code blocks very rarely, the technique might not be helpful unless you know how to reproduce the issue in a narrow window of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Here’s where <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html">Async Hooks</a> come&nbsp;in.</p>
<h2 id="async-hooks-new-possibilities">Async Hooks - new&nbsp;possibilities</h2>
<p>Their main purpose is to allow diagnosing asynchronous workflows in general and their first use case was creating an asynchronous stack trace. With <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> hooks I was able to measure the time taken and the <code>init</code> hook is where a stack trace can be saved. That’s effectively the whole idea behind <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/blocked-at"><code>blocked-at</code></a>&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>I made sure it’s similar to the original one, so it’s easy to switch.
Once you run it, you’ll want to analyze the stack traces it&nbsp;collects.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-bug">Finding the&nbsp;bug</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an&nbsp;example.</p>
<pre><code>at Promise.then (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
  at Immediate.start (/.../blocked-at/test/cases/promise.js:8:6)
  at runCallback (timers.js:781:20)
  at tryOnImmediate (timers.js:743:5)
  at processImmediate [as _immediateCallback] (timers.js:714:5)
</code></pre><p>It’s a stack trace from a test case in the unit tests for <code>blocked-at</code>. It demonstrates what you’ll get if you’re using promises and a <code>.then</code> handler is synchronously running a long&nbsp;operation.</p>
<p>Now compare with the code which produced this stack&nbsp;trace.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="meta">'use strict'</span>
<span class="keyword">const</span> slow = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'../slowfunc'</span>)

<span class="built_in">module</span>.exports = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">start</span> (<span class="params"></span>) </span>{
  <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class="number">1</span>)
    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">a</span> =&gt;</span> a++)
    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">a</span> =&gt;</span> [a])
    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">a</span> =&gt;</span> {
      a[<span class="number">0</span>] = <span class="number">1</span>
      slow()
      <span class="keyword">return</span> a
    })
    .catch(<span class="built_in">console</span>.error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note how <code>blocked-at</code> told us that the offending line is <code>.then(a =&gt; {</code>. It’s the beginning of the function containing the actual blocking operation somewhere inside <code>slow()</code> function&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>To successfully debug your eventloop blocking code you need to start in the reported line and review all synchronous operations going through function execution while ignoring anything that’s in a callback or .then&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h2 id="when-stack-trace-is-not-enough">When stack trace is not&nbsp;enough</h2>
<p>Sometimes your code is in a callback you pass somewhere to be called synchronously.
Here’s what <code>blocked-at</code> would report if slow operation happened in a http&nbsp;handler.</p>
<pre><code>at Server.connectionListener (_http_server.js:307:10)
  at emitOne (events.js:115:13)
  at Server.emit (events.js:210:7)
  at TCP.onconnection (net.js:1560:8)
</code></pre><p>If you see a case like that, all hope is not lost. You have a hint about what kind of asynchronous beginning there was. You can now wrap contents of your handler function in a <code>setImmediate</code> to get a stack trace from within your&nbsp;codebase.</p>
<h2 id="share-your-stack-trace-">Share your stack&nbsp;trace!</h2>
<p>I’m hoping to collect more real-life examples of stack traces and build a knowledge base of the less obvious&nbsp;ones.</p>
